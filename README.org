* ob-grpc
ob-grpc provides functions for making grpc calls through org-babel,
using [[https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl][grpcurl]].

** Installation

Not available on melpa yet.  Currently the easiest way to install is
to use [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]]

#+begin_src elisp
(straight-use-package
 '(ob-grpc :type git :host github :repo "shsms/ob-grpc"))
#+end_src

Or with ~use-package~ + ~straight.el~

#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package ob-grpc
    :straight (ob-grpc :type git :host github :repo "shsms/ob-grpc")
    :bind (:map org-mode-map
                ("C-c g i" . ob-grpc-init)
                ("C-c g b" . ob-grpc-insert-block)))
#+end_src

Also install [[https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl][grpcurl]].

Optionally, add the below to your ~init.el~ to prevent a confirmation request from
org-babel every time you execute a block:

#+begin_src elisp
  (defun my-org-confirm-babel-evaluate (lang body)
    (not (member lang '(
                        "grpc"
                        ;; other source languages
                        ))))

  (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate 'my-org-confirm-babel-evaluate)
#+end_src

** Usage

*** Init
In an empty org buffer, run ~M-x ob-grpc-init~.  This would add these
properties to the buffer:

#+begin_src org
  :PROPERTIES:
  :GRPC-ENDPOINT: [::1]:8080
  :PROTO-FILE: ./proto/service.proto
  :PROTO-IMPORT-PATH: proto
  :PLAIN-TEXT: yes
  :END:
#+end_src

*Notes:*
- Update their values as necessary.
- When using TLS, set ~:PLAIN-TEXT:~ to ~no~.
- Separate multiple import paths by a space character.

*** Insert org-babel blocks

Run ~M-x ob-grpc-insert-block~.  That would prompt for a method name,
with all the methods in the ~:PROTO-FILE:~ as completion options.
Choose one, and it will automatically insert an org block, with the
method name, and a template message for the request type of the
message.  For example,

#+begin_src org
> #+begin_src grpc :method echo.Echo.Echo
> {
>   "str": ""
> }
> #+end_src
#+end_src

*** Execute the block

Update the request object as necessary, and press ~C-c C-c~ inside the block.

** Troubleshooting

There is not a lot of error handling at the moment.  So when something
doesn't work as expected, visit the ~*Messages*~ buffer.  All the calls
to ~grpcurl~ and responses are logged there.

No support for streaming grpc methods yet.
